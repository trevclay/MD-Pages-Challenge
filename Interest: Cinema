# My favorite movies (*of all time*)
> Let me say that ranking movies is not something I am capable of because they all have their merits/demerits. I will say that I think some movies have objective merits but fall some due to inconsistencies. Here are my top 10 (animated and live action)
## In no particular order:
1. The Dark Knight
2. Oppenheimer
3. Shrek
4. Shrek 2
5. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
6. Inglorious Bastards
7. Man of Steel
8. Star Wars Episode III
9. Pulp Fiction
10. Pineapple Express
